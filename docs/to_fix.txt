Tests not working:

1. test_analyze_nyctlc

    • create_summary : trips_analysis_test table does not exist in test.db, missing create table 	query?

2. test_nyiso

    • test_clean_isolf: assertion error NaN is returned and test says shape has only 1 column, test seems incorrect
      
    • test_clean_palint: key mismatch, consider passing keys as arguments instead of using hardcodes
      
    • test_create_expected_load: dataframe format seems incorrect, df[‘datetime’] not datetime type
      
    • test_create_standard_load: expected_load table does not exist, should add setUp() to make tests independent
      
    • test_import_load: zone_name/name keyError, same as clean_palint

Process outline:

Shift framework to unittests

Discuss with Jacob regarding missing data files

Figure out whether method needs to be modified to enable better testing

Rewrite tests which are not working

Add more assertions in working tests
